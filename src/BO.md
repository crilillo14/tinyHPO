BOth random and grid search are straightforward to implement. 

Think of a mountain range. You *could* look at random points and ask, "Is this the highest point? Is that the highest point?".
You could also look at each individual stone in the mountain range and ask, "Is this higher than the highest point I've looked at?".
 
But realistically, no human is that inefficient at inspecting a mountain range. 

Bayesian Optimization is a complicated topic that is extremely useful for combining random search's sparcity and grid search's
effectiveness at finding global maxima.
