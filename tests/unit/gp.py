# test samping from gp, make sure it is uniform
# measure KL with U^H

# test that fits dont give linear algebra errors, 
# cruxes include
# cholesku decomposition
# matrix inversion
# positive definiteness
# non - explosiveness
# ...

# ton of non runtime error checks that need to be implemented. 

# Make sure that appropriate behavior appears in special edge cases 

# make sure that stuff like blank callables from user model don't break hpo search.
